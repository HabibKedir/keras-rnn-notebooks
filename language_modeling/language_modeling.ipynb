    "# <font color='#6629b2'>Language modeling with recurrent neural networks using Keras</font>\n",

    "## <font color='#6629b2'>Overview</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "I am going to show how to build a recurrent neural network (RNN) language model that learns the relation between words in text, using the Keras library for machine learning. I will then show how this model can be used to compute the probability of a sequence, as well as generate new sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color='#6629b2'>Language Modeling</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "A language model is a model of the probability of word sequences. These models are useful for a variety of tasks, such as ones that require selecting the most likely output from a set of candidates provided by a speech recognition or machine translation system, for example. Here, I'll show how a language model can be used to generate sequences, in particular the endings of stories. Language generation is a difficult research problem which is generally addressed by more complex models than the one shown here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, the most well-known approach to language modeling relies on n-grams. The limitation of n-gram language models is that they only explicitly model the probability of a sequence of *n* words. In contrast, RNNs can model longer sequences and thus typically are better at predicting which words will appear in a sequence. See the [chapter in Jurafsky & Martin's *Speech and Language Processing*](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/4.pdf) to learn more about traditional approaches to language modeling. \n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color='#6629b2'>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "RNNs are a general framework for modeling sequence data and are particularly useful for natural language processing tasks. At a high level, RNN encode sequences via a set of parameters (weights) that are optimized to predict some output variable. The focus of this notebook is on the code needed to assemble a model in Keras, as well as some data processing tools that facilitate building the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you understand how to structure the input and output of the model, and know the fundamental concepts in machine learning, then a high-level understanding of how an RNN works is sufficient for using Keras. You'll see that most of the code here is actually just data manipulation, and I'll visualize each step in this process. The code used to assemble the RNN itself is more minimal. It is of course useful to know the technical details of the RNN, so you can theorize on the results and innovate the model to make it better. For a better understanding of RNNs and neural networks in general, see the resources at the bottom of the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here an RNN will be used as a language model, which can predict which word is likely to occur next in a text given the words before it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color='#6629b2'>Keras</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "[Keras](https://keras.io/) is a Python deep learning framework that lets you quickly put together neural network models with a minimal amount of code. It can be run on top of [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) or [Tensor Flow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) without you needing to know either of these underlying frameworks. It provides implementations of several of the layer architectures, objective functions, and optimization algorithms you need for building a model."

    "My research is on story generation, so I've selected a dataset of stories as the text to be modeled by the RNN. They come from the [ROCStories](http://cs.rochester.edu/nlp/rocstories/) dataset, which consists of thousands of five-sentence stories about everyday life events. Here the model will be trained to predict each word in the story based on the preceding words. Then we'll use the trained model to generate the final sentence in a set of stories not observed during training. The full dataset is available at the above link and just requires filling out a form to get access. Here, I'll use a sample of 100 stories."

Each tokenized word in the stories is added to the lexicon, and then each word is mapped to a numerical index that can be read by the model. Since large datasets may contain a huge number of unique words, it's common to filter all words occurring less than a certain number of times, and replace them with some generic &lt;UNK&gt; token. The min_freq parameter in the function below defines this threshold. In the example code, the min_freq parameter is set to 1, so the lexicon will contain all unique words in the training set. When assigning the indices, the number 1 will represent unknown words. The number 0 will represent \"empty\" word slots, which is explained below. Therefore \"real\" words will have indices of 2 or higher."

This enables the model to process the stories in batches as opposed to one at a time, which significantly speeds up training. However, each story has a different number of words. So we create a padded matrix equal to the length on the longest story in the training set. For all stories with fewer words, we prepend the row with zeros, each representing an empty word position. This is why the number 0 was not assigned as a word index in the lexicon. Then we can actually tell Keras to ignore these zeros during training."

    "To assemble the model, we'll use Keras' [Functional API](https://keras.io/getting-started/functional-api-guide/), which is one of two ways to use Keras to assemble models (the alternative is the [Sequential API](https://keras.io/getting-started/sequential-model-guide/), which is a bit simpler but has more constraints). A model consists of a series of layers. As shown in the code below, we initialize instances for each layer. Each layer can be called with another layer as input, e.g. Embedding()(input_layer). A model instance is initialized with the Model() object, which defines the initial input and final output layers for that model. Before the model can be trained, the compile() function must be called with the loss function and optimization algorithm specified (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "###  <font color='#6629b2'>Layers</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll build an RNN with five layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Input**: The input layer takes in the matrix of word indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Embedding**: An [embedding input layer](https://keras.io/layers/embeddings/) that converts integer word indices into distributed vector representations (embeddings). The mask_zero=True parameter indicates that values of 0 in the matrix (the padding) will be ignored by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. GRU**: A [recurrent (GRU) hidden layer](https://keras.io/layers/recurrent/), the central component of the model. As it observes each word in the story, it integrates the word embedding representation with what it's observed so far to compute a representation (hidden state) of the story at that timepoint. There are a few architectures for this layer - I use the GRU variation, Keras also provides LSTM or just the simple vanilla recurrent layer (see the materials at the bottom for an explanation of the difference). By setting return_sequences=True for this layer, it will output the hidden states for every timepoint in the model, i.e. for every word in the story.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. GRU**: A second recurrent layer that takes the first as input and operates the same way, since adding more layers generally improves the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. (Time Distributed) Dense**: A [dense output layer](https://keras.io/layers/core/#dense) that outputs a probability for each word in the lexicon, where each probability indicates the chance of that word being the next word in the sequence. The 'softmax' activation is what transforms the values of this layer into scores from 0 to 1 that can be treated as probabilities. The Dense layer produces the probability scores for one particular timepoint (word). By wrapping this in a TimeDistributed() layer, the model outputs a probability distribution for every timepoint in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"layer\" is just an abstraction, when really all these layers are just matrices. The \"weights\" that connect the layers are also matrices. The process of training a neural network is a series of matrix multiplications. The weight matrices are the values that are adjusted during training in order for the model to learn to predict the next word.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  <font color='#6629b2'>Parameters</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Our function for creating the model takes the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "**seq_input_len:** the length of the input and output matrices. This is equal to the length of the longest story in the training data. \n",
    "\n",
    "**n_input_nodes**: the number of unique words in the lexicon, plus one to account for the padding represented by 0 values. This indicates the number of rows in the embedding layer, where each row corresponds to a word. It is also the dimensionality of the probability vectors given as the model output.\n",
    "\n",
    "**n_embedding_nodes**: the number of dimensions (units) in the embedding layer, which can be freely defined. Here, it is set to 300.\n",
    "\n",
    "**n_hidden_nodes**: the number of dimensions in the hidden layers. Like the embedding layer, this can be freely chosen. Here, it is set to 500.\n",
    "\n",
    "**stateful**: By default, the GRU hidden layer will reset its state (i.e. its values will be 0s) each time a new set of sequences is read into the model.  However, when stateful=True is given, this parameter indicates that the GRU hidden layer should \"remember\" its state until it is explicitly told to forget it. In other words, the values in this layer will be carried over between separate calls to the training function. This is useful when processing long sequences, so that the model can iterate through chunks of the sequences rather than loading the entire matrix at the same time, which is memory-intensive. I'll show below how this setting is also useful when the model is used for word prediction after training. During training, the model will observe all words in a story at once, so stateful will be set to False. At prediction time, it will be set to True.\n",
    "\n",
    "**batch_size**: It is not always necessary to specify the batch size when setting up a Keras model. The fit() function will apply batch processing by default and the batch size can be given as a parameter. However, when a model is stateful, the batch size does need to be specified in the Input() layers. Here, for training, batch_size=None, so Keras will use its default batch size (which is 32). During prediction, the batch size will be set to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color='#6629b2'>Procedure</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the model is a sequence of vectors, each with the same number of dimensions as the number of unique words (n_input_nodes). Each vector contains the predicted probability of each possible word appearing in that position in the sequence. Like all neural networks, RNNs learn by updating the parameters (weights) to optimize an objective (loss) function applied to the output. For this model, the objective is to minimize the cross-entropy (named as \"sparse_categorical_crossentropy\" in the code) between the predicted word probabilities and the probabilities observed from the words that appear in the training data, resulting in probabilities that more accurately predict when a particular word will appear. This is the general procedure used for all multi-label classification tasks. Updates to the weights of the model are performed using an optimization algorithm, such as Adam used here. The details of this process are extensive; see the resources at the bottom of the notebook if you want a deeper understanding. One huge benefit of Keras is that it implements many of these details for you. Not only does it already have implementations of the types of layer architectures, it also has many of the [loss functions](https://keras.io/losses/) and [optimization methods](https://keras.io/optimizers/) you need for training various models."

The closer perplexity is to 0, the better the model is at predicting the given sequences. This number does not indicate the performance of a model when applied to a specific task, but it is still useful for showing relative differences between models in terms of how well they fit the data.

As opposed to training where we processed multiple stories at the same time, it will be more straightforward to demonstrate prediction on a single story at a time, especially since prediction is fast relative to training.

    "The language model can also be used to generate new text. Here, I'll give the same predictor model the first four sentences of a story in the test set and have it generate the fifth sentence. To do this, we \"load\" the first four sentences into the model. This can be done using predict() function. Because the model is stateful, predict() saves the representation of the story internally even though we don't need the output of this function when just reading the story. Once the final word in the fourth sentence has been read, then we can start using the resulting probability distribution to predict the first word in the fifth sentence. We can call numpy.random.choice() to randomly sample a word according to its probability. Now we again call predict() with this new word as input, which returns a probability distribution for the second word. Again, we sample from this distribution, append the newly sampled word to the previously generated word, and call predict() with this new word as input. We continue doing this until a word that ends with an end-of-sentence puncutation mark (\".\", \"!\", \"?\") has been selected. Just as before, reset_states() is called after the whole sentence has been generated. Then we can decode the generated ending into a string using the lexicon lookup dictionary. You can see that the generated endings are generally not as coherent and well-formed as the human-authored endings, but they do capture some components of the story and they are often entertaining."

    "To help visualize the data representation inside the model, we can look at the output of each layer individually. Keras' Functional API lets you derive a new model with the layers from an existing model, so you can define the output to be a layer below the output layer in the original model. Calling predict() on this new model will produce the output of that layer for a given input. Of course, glancing at the numbers by themselves doesn't provide any interpretation of what the model has learned (although there are opportunities to [interpret these values](https://www.civisanalytics.com/blog/interpreting-visualizing-neural-networks-text-processing/)), but seeing them verifies the model is just a series of transformations from one matrix to another. The model stores its layers as the list model.layers, and you can retrieve specific layer by its position index in the model. Below is an example of the word embedding output for the first word in the first story of the test set. You can do this same thing to view any layer."
